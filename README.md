This program was written to automatically generate customised practice material for my Chinese class.

The code is pretty poor, because all that matters is the output.

Unfortunately you can't actually run this program without some data files I can't really distribute.

However, character sheets generated for my class for every day of February 2020 are available from https://zici.info/announce/2020-02/revision.html
